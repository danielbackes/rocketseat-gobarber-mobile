## üìñ Main concepts that I learned in this project
  - Use react navigation, recovery route params, create stack, tab and drawer navigation.
  - Mobile application has Pixel Density concept, that need to each image 3 image with different resolution. The 1x image, named as <image-name>.png; the 2x image, named <image-name>@2x.png and the 3x image, named as <image-name>@3x.png. The Image component, from react-native, will choose the image that will be used depending on the smartphone density.
  - Use external fonts and how use icons.
  - There is the react-native-iphone-x-helper library to help create styles that better fit to IOS. Also exists the Platform component, inside of react-native library, that help create styles to each mobile platform.
  - React-native library has the KeyboardAvoidingView component to surround the components that should't be overlapping by the keyboard when it is shown.
  - Known some attributes and functions of the TextInput: KeyboardType, AutoCorrect, AutoCapitalize, ReturnKeyType, OnSubmitEdition.
  - UseImperativeHandle hook provides a way to change the ref object created by a father component inside a child component.
  - Learn how use the react-native-image-picker library to create an image selector, that allow select an image from the gallery or take photo with the camera.
  - Configure the jest library to execute test.
  - Configure Icon and Splash image.
  - Generate keystore and build Android App Bundle.
  - Create an app on Google Play Store.
  - Config the AppCenter Platform to deploy and deliver the app on Google Play.
